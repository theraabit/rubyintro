# To run this code, be sure your current working directory
# is the same as where this file is located and then run:
# ruby 3-arrays.rb

# Arrays are lists of things
favorite_foods = ["tacos","pizza", "ice cream"]
# puts favorite_foods

# we_have_to_go_back = [4,8,15,16,23,42]
# puts we_have_to_go_back

# mixed_array = ["tacos", 12, true]
# puts mixed_array

# shopping_list = [["coffee", "oatly"],["beer", "pizza"]]
# puts shopping_list

# Accessing the array

# Add to the array
favorite_foods.push("chicken")
puts favorite_foods.size
puts favorite_foods.count
puts favorite_foods.length
